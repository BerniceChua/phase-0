# Pad an Array

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ]

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# is commented in the file.



# 0. Pseudocode

=begin
# What is the input?
INPUT = array

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
output for pad = a different modified array, 
    but original array is unchanged
output for pad! = the input array, but modified

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

for pad
Step 1: get inputs:
    1 array
    1 integer (total # of elements in array)
    OPTIONAL: 1 argument for what we will use to fill out array
        (if not specified, default = nil [the actual value of nil, not a String that says "nil"])
Step 2:

# 1. Initial Solution
def pad!(array, min_size, value = nil) #destructive
  # Your code here
end

def pad(array, min_size, value = nil) #non-destructive
  # Your code here
end
