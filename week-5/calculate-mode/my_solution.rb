# Calculate the mode Pairing Challenge

# I worked on this challenge [with: Trevor Newcomb (navigator)]

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented.



# 0. Pseudocode
=begin

# What is the input?
# an array

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# the most common element of the array

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
Step 1: get input
Step 2: make variable to hold result -- called "mode"
Step 3: iterate through the input array
Step 3.1: if the value of this element has NOT yet already been encountered, 
            make it a new key, and add 1 to its counter.
Step 3.2: if the value of this element has already been encountered,
            add 1 to the counter of its existing key.
Step 4: return the key with the highest value
