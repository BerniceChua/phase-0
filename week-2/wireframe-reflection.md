Release 4: Reflect

In the reflection file you just created, answer the following questions. 

1. What is a wireframe?

<<<<<<< HEAD
   A wireframe is like a blueprint or plan of the layout of the design of a website according to how the designer wants the user to process information presented.  It is usually done in a very bare-bones style so as not to get distracted by the colors or typefaces.

2. What are the benefits of wireframing?

   Wireframing is useful because it lets the designer define the hierarchy of the design, making it easier for them to plan and test the layout according to the way a user would navigate the site without being distracted by colors, fonts, or the words on the site.

   This testing is useful because we don't need to waste too much time coding for the style of something that appeared like a cool idea in our heads, but it turns out to be something that we didn't want.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
   The other benefit of why a wireframe is simple and bare-bones is so that the person(s) working on it will not be too invested in the idea, and it will be easier to change the layout/style later since nobody is really that invested in the style/layout.

3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

   Yes, wireframing became enjoyable after getting used to it, and getting "in the zone", when all the ideas come out.  

4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

   I stuck with the first idea, which had plenty of edits inside it.  But it might probably change when I add more style & content.  

5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

   As I was wireframing, I kept asking myself whether or not the layout made sense visually or intuitively.  In order to find the answer, I looked at what I considered "intuitive" and easy-to-use websites, and thought about: 
      - Why I thought that way about them
      - What I liked about them
      - What I didn't like about them, and how I would have implemented it better if I were the designer.

6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

   I found it tedious to test out the different wireframing tools listed here: http://mashable.com/2010/07/15/wireframing-tools/#PnzoSkXBqgqg

   Mainly, I was trying to test which one works and which one does not work.  

   Wireframing in and of itself was only somewhat tedious, but I understand that it will prevent more tedium and headaches later down the road and I think that I will get used to it.  It was definitely helpful to our development process because everything is laid out plainly in front of us, so we can test if something makes sense visually.  This testing is useful because we don't need to waste too much time coding for the style of something that appeared like a cool idea in our heads, but it turns out to be something that we didn't want.  

   I think that wireframing became enjoyable after a while.
