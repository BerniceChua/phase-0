			- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
			-- Jacob: "Everything that we learned in theory worked exactly the same as in practice. Translating a page into html was fairly straightforward and there was very little that we had to research."
			-- Bernice: "I have previous experience with HTML, but I remember the first time that I wrote code for a page, it was nice to feel that even though writing code looked intimidating and complicated, it's do-able."

			- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
			-- Jacob: Since we have yet to work with CSS, the purpose of semantic elements is still slightly unclear to me. I am a kinesthetic learner, so I will understand their purpose better once we use them to make styling easier.
			-- Bernice: "Researching how to use the semantic HTML5 elements was easy and straightforward.  Jacob & I discussed why someone would use a div as opposed to a table, and everything really depends on the purpose of that part in the code."

			- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
			-- Jacob: "I think we did very well at keeping to best practices in our code. For example, we did nothing to adjust the style of the page; we worked strictly with HTML and did not worry about the size of text, its color, etc."
			-- Bernice: "It was easy to keep best practices i.e no formatting in HTML, because the rules were straightforward and simple to follow."

			- What seems good and bad about HTML?
			-- Jacob: I haven't worked with HTML for long enough to understand why it's preferable over other markup languanges. From my research, it seems that HTML is the only universally-used markup language. For a beginner, it seems the tags may become confusing. Sublime doesn't alert us if we make mistakes in our code, so we must verify it using an online tool once in a while to make sure we haven't forgotten to close a tag.
			-- Bernice: 
				"
					A. Good things about HTML:
						1. Easy to see the output right away, as opposed to .md files.  So if there's a mistake, it can be corrected right away.
						2. HTML is more "universal", so it's easy for many people to read it.  
						3. The person in charge of making the content can just concentrate on writing the content & structure.  The tags/markups makes HTML really flexible in terms of how something will be presented later through CSS or jQuery or something else.
					 B. Bad things about HTML:
					 	1. Very easy to lose track of the tags.
					 	2. A little tedious, but not as tedious as .md files.
				"
			- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
			-- Jacob: At this point, I can't honestly say I have developed any "tricks." I find I remember tags only after practicing them; memory tricks such as acronyms and sequencing only have limited effect for me.
			-- Bernice: "A trick that I remember for how to write HTML is to write the tags first, then fill in the content later; since this makes it easier to keep track of whether the tags are closed."
