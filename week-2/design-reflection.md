In the reflection file you just created, copy and answer the following questions (or create a video and link to it). 

- What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  1. Gathering Information = the web designer(s) should find out the purpose of the project, the goal(s), the target audience, and what kind of content the website needs to convey.  (Although "purpose" & "goals" seem the same, so I don't know why they needed to be differentiated.)
  2. Planning = based on the information gathered, plan the layout, make the site map as a framework/guide.  Also, the kind of technology to use can be decided and planned based on the gathered information.
  3. Designing = determine the look and feel of the website, create prototypes or mock-ups, and get feedback on those.
  4. Development = create the website based on step 1, 2, and 3.
  5. Testing & delivery = make sure there are no bugs, no broken links, etc, and everything functions as expected.  Then upload it to the internet
  6. Maintenance = add features or other information; updating the website.

- What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

   My site's primary goal is to present my work & skills, and to let others get to know me professionally.

- What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

   My target audience's interest is to find someone with the skills that they need.  My site will address that by presenting what skills I have, so they can decide if my skills suit their needs.  

- What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

   I want their primary action to be to see my portfolio, know my skills, and contact me.  

- What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

   Design is not just about aesthetics or making things looks pretty and fancy.  While aesthetics are a part of design, desgin is mainly about solving problems to meet the user(s)' need(s).  This includes making the experience pleasant, accessible, and easy for users.  

- What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

   User Exeprience (UX) design is valuable because if the user's experience is bad, the product (website, program, app, physical thing) does not accomplish what it needs (informing people, addressing a need), and people will not want to use the product because they will be annoyed and frustrated.  So all the effort into creating the product will just be wasted.  Plus, it might give the creators a bad reputation.  

- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

   The part that I found most tedious about this challenge is that I cannot preview the formatting of Markdown before I do `git add`, `git commit -m`, and `git push...`.  I understand that it's ok to iterate for correcting mistakes, but it's really annoying that I cannot test anything first.
