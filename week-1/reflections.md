# Dev Bootcamp Reflections
## 1.1 Think About Time
While the module "1.1 Think About Time" has taught several time management and productivity techniques, I think that I may have had an advantage here, because of 3 things before I even started Dev Bootcamp:

First of all, I saw these videos in youtube: 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo (Randy Pausch Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0 (Randy Pausch Lecture: Time Management)

Second of all, because of circumstances in my life (because... REASONS!), I have read these books:
- "You Can't Manage Time: But You Can Manage Many Priorities" by Susan de la Vergne
- "Eat That Frog!" by Brian Tracy
- "Emotional Intelligence 2.0" by Jean Greaves and Travis Bradberry
- "You Are Not So Smart" By David Mcraney

And the third and last reason of all, is because the acceptance email from Dev Bootcamp has a link to the Phase 0 pre-requisites - https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/phase-0-prerequisites.md.  One of the links in the pre-requisites is a Coursera course called Learning How to Learn (https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/).  

It is good to know that the things that all of those external resources are teaching, are actually almost the same as what's provided in this module.  This means that I wasn't wasting my time, and that I have been doing the correct thing all along!  And this means that since so many experts agree, these methods must be working.  The techniques reinforce each other, and complement each other at the same time.  For example, both "Learning How To Learn" and pomodorotechnique.com both teach the Pomodoro technique, which lets a person focus on a task for 25 minutes straight with no distractions.  This is similar to what is taught in Timeboxing (http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/timebox.html), which is an Agile technique where a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal at a previously agreed period of time -- instead of allowing work to continue until the goal is reached -- and then evaluating the time taken.  The timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished.  Also, "Emotional Intelligence 2.0" & and "The Power of Meditation" & "How Mindfulness can improve productivity, focus, and work life balance" & "Tricks for Getting into the Zone" all teach about self-awareness and how that would help us get in the "flow" or "in the zone" or "in the groove".  At the same time, self-awareness and emotional intelligence allows people to catch their own reactions and cues/triggers.  And "Learning How To Learn" and "Fogg Method" and "Habits & Growth Mindset" and "Make it big by starting small" and "Create A Habit" all talk about starting with small good habits that will eventually become significant.  Specifically similar is how "Learning How To Learn" and BJ Fogg who did the "Fogg Method" and Charles Duhigg talk about when wanting to start a new good habit and to manage time/make use of time wisely, a person needs to realize a cue/"When I do this xyz-thing", they will react to it with the new good habit that they want to do.  Then they will reward themselves (Charles Duhigg gives the chocolates as a reward for exercising as his example, BJ Fogg says to have a mini-celebration, like saying "Bingo!"/"Thumbs up!"/"I'm awesome!!").  

The most common theme that I've noticed in all of them, they have this theme: willpower is finite.  In order to change a habit so that a person can learn or manage time wisely, a person will use their willpower as reactions to cues.  The cues can be anything like "When I sit down on my computer" or "After I pee" or "When I turn on my Pomodoro timer".  The reaction can be "I will look at my to-do list and my calendar first" or "I will do 2 pushups" or "I will do this one task only until the Pomodoro timer runs out."  The new good habit needs to be small to be easy to be done.  And after that, the person should reward himself/herself to associate finishing the task with a good feeling, and the person would have more and more belief in themselves.  After a while, the person has conditioned his/her behavior to do more and more of them.  And a lot of the techniques for time management and productivity emphasize on the process, not the product.  The best ways to do these are to have these in such a way that they are already built-in to what a person is going to do anyway, so that it will be easy to just fall into that mode, and the best way to manage time and make new good habits is to customize it to your personality.  And finally, the most important thing is to have an end-time scheduled.  Why is scheduling an end-time important?  I think it is so that the person will not feel that "I have all day to do this!  I can dilly-dally or put this off."  

My favorite new ones are actually http://pomodorotechnique.com/ignore-the-unicorn/ and https://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/ because I have ADD, and as http://pomodorotechnique.com/ignore-the-unicorn/ describes, there's this “Fear of Missing Out” or fear of forgetting the idea/what needs to be done, because there are just so many things that need to get done.  Since I can think of each Pomodoro as a discreet unit, "... when your head is full of 50 things you could be doing right now, to know for certain that I’m in exactly the right place and doing exactly the right thing right now.”  Every time I have a distracting thought or idea, I just write it down before powering on with the rest of the Pomodoro.  The reason why I like "https://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/" is because it encourages people to customize time management and productivity to suit their own personalities and figure out what works for each individual.  

So that answers the question "Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?".  It's not that I learned something new, but it's more of what already know is reinforced as something good.  


- What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

   Time boxing is an Agile approach where a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal at a previously agreed period of time, and consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished. -- instead of allowing work to continue until the goal is reached.  It can be used in Phase 0 to pace myself and to see how much I can do within a set amount of time, probably in conjunction with a Pomodoro.  At the same time, if I don't complete a task within the alloted time of timeboxing, I can use that break time afterwards so I can have my mind refreshed.  Also, it's a good way to force myself to realize that I'm stuck on something so the end of the timebox might be a good time to ask questions.  

- How do you manage your time currently?

   Currently, this is my strategy:

   I manage my time by extensively using my Google calendar & to-do list (there's a to-do list inside Google calendar & my phone, then there's the separate to-do list inside Canvas) and using a Pomodoro for each item in my to-do list.  

   In the evening before I sleep, I look at the to-do list for the next day's calendar, then prioritize which one needs to be done first.  Since I don't have to worry about remembering what I need to do the next day, I just sleep peacefully.  In the morning, I use an alarm clock to wake me up.  

   In the day time, I just look at the calendar and to-do list, and for each item in the to-do list, I set a Pomodoro timer for it.  When I get a new idea or have something else that I want to do while I'm in a Pomodoro, I add it to my to-do list so I don't have to worry about forgetting it.  (Example of using a cue/trigger to signal a reaction/habit.)  

   Also I set an alarm clock for what time I need to start doing something, what time I'll need to be leaving from a place (due to how long it takes to get somewhere like for example traffic), etc.  The alarms are good cues/triggers also.  

- Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

   Before reaching this strategy, I experimented with a bunch of other strategies to see what suits me the best.  They emphasize a process over a product, and they were cues/triggers that helped me build small habits over time.  The current strategy works for me because I can see where I need to go/where my appointments are at specific times, and what I need to accomplish so I don't have to think about what I need to do next because I just do it.  If some emergency happens and I need to be taken away from my work, it's easy to remember where I was at.  The strategy works most of the time when nobody is around to interrupt me, but I always let people know what I'm doing with my time so they will not interrupt me.  It does not work all the time, because sometimes people don't understand what I'm doing and they get mad that they need to be fit into my schedule.  

- Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

   I will try to employ timeboxing in addition to what I already do, because timeboxing is a new idea for me since I like finishing something when the goal is reached/when it is completed.  What I used to do is to chain several Pomodoros and 5-minute break-times together until I finish something.  But it's always good to try something new and see if it will make me better.  

- What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

   My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is my current routine mentioned above because it is effective and proven to work.  But I will incorporate timeboxing because that way, I have a finite amount of time, and when I go over that time threshold and cannot figure something out, that's my signal that it's time to ask for help.  

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"

   The shell is a kind of UI (user interface) to access an operating system.  There are 2 kinds of shells: CLI (command line interface), where everything is bare bones text display and just words and our inputs are only text commands.  GUI (graphical user interface), where we can use both the keyboard and the cursor as inputs.

   "bash" stands for "Born Again Shell", and is a kind of CLI.  

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

   It was not challenging for me at all, because I use the command line a lot.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

   Yes.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

   In my opinion, the most important commands to know are "help" and "man", because if someone can access those, even if they don't remember the other commands, then "help" can help them with the command that they need, and "man" is the manual of the shell, so it has the guide/documentation for the syntax, etc. of the commands in the command line and what else you can do with them.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head?

   Yes.

6. Write what each does.
  - `pwd` = "print working directory", which tells the user which directory is currently being displayed/viewed.

  - `ls` = "list", which lists all of the contents of the current directory that you are in, which you found out through pwd.

  - `mv` = "move" which moves a file to a new location.  Also, it will rename the file if you type `mv [old_name] [new_name]`.

  - `cd` = "change directory", which moves the user to a different directory/lets the user view a different directory.

  - `../` = it means "up one directory".  If you type `cd ../`, your current folder will become the folder where the directory that you were just at "lives".  Example, if you are in `/my_outer_directory/my_inner_directory`, and you type `cd ../`, your current directory will now be `/my_outer_directory`.  Please note that if you are in the root directory `/`, typing `cd ../` will not do anything, because it is the outermost directory.  

  - `touch` = creates a new file that is empty if you type `touch [my_filename]`.

  - `mkdir` = makes a new directory aka subfolder aka subdirectory in the current directory.

  - `less` = is named that way as a joke because of `more`.  Just like `more`, it will allow you to read the contents of a file, and allows you to scroll back up and also scroll down with the arrow keys.  You can also use regex to look for a specific word if you want.

  - `rmdir` = "remove directory", which deletes an empty directory.

  - `rm` = "remove", which deletes a file.

  - `help`: 
     - If you type `help` by itself, you will get the version of the shell that you're using.  
     - If you type `help [name of command here]`, it will display more about the command you are asking help about.  
     - If you type `[command] --help`, it will show you the usage options of what you can do with the command you are asking help about.

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
1. If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?

Instructions for creating a new repo:

> Step 1 - If you don't have this already, create a login and password in GitHub.  

> Step 2 - In your own GitHub page, look for the "+" sign on the upper right corner beside your avatar/picture.  You'll know you're in the right place because when you hover over it, a sign will appear that says "Create new...".

> Step 3 - Click on "+" sign on upper right corner beside your avatar/picture.  A dropdown menu appears.

> Step 4 - On dropdown menu, please click "New repository".  A new screen will appear.

> Step 5 - In this new screen, you can customize things about your repo such as the name.  Please choose the name of your repo, choose whether or not the repo is public vs. private, and choose what kind of license is being used, since these are required.  The others are optional, but you can add information on them if you want.  

> Step 6 - When you have made sure that everything in Step 5 is to your liking, please click "Create Repository".  Congratulations!  You have made a repository in GitHub.

> Step 7 - In order to add more files to this repository, let us link it to your local machine through git.  For this, please make sure that you have git installed from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads (Links to an external site.)

> `git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username Here"`

> `git config --global user.email "your.email@address.com"`

(The End)

 

Instructions for forking an existing repo:

> Step 1 - If you don't have this already, create a login and password in GitHub.  

> Step 2 - Please go to the GitHub page of whichever repo you'd wish to fork.

> Step 3 - On the upper right corner of the screen, under your avatar/picture, there is a button called "Fork".  Please click on this.  

> Step 4 - Congratulations!  You have successfully forked a repo.  You'll know that you have done this correctly if the name before the slash of the repo name is your own username, and under that, it says "forked from originalUser/source" or something like that, and the picture beside it is a branch instead of a book.  

> Step 5 -  In order to add more files to this repository, let us link it to your local machine through git.  For this, please make sure that you have git installed from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads (Links to an external site.).

> Step 6 - On the right sidebar of the forked repo's page, there is a box under "HTTPS clone URL".  Please click the box beside it that says "Copy to clipboard" when you hover over it.

> Step 7 - Please open your CLI.  Please "cd" to the directory where you want to save your cloned git repos.

> Step 8 - Once you are in the directory that you want, please type this command:

> `git clone ` (and before hitting "Enter" on the keyboard, paste the URL that was copied in Step 6.  NOW, hit Enter).

> Congratulations!  You now have a copy of this forked repo on your desktop.

(The End)



2. Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

   The answer to this question really depends on what you want to do.  If you want to create something from scratch, then you would create a new repository.  But if you want to work on existing code, then it is better to fork a repository instead of creating a new one, so that you don't have to copy each file manually.  

3. What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

   I did not struggle setting up git and GitHub this time, because I used it for work before.  For that reason, I knew that git is different than GitHub, because my former work used a different place to host the master branch of their repo, with its own login and password.  But I can remember what it was like when I set up git and GitHub for my very first time.  During the very first time that I created a downloaded and installed git, I tried to create a local repository following the instructions in the guide at https://git-scm.com/documentation (Links to an external site.).  I missed some steps, so I wanted to start from the beginning, but I got error messages because I had already did "git init" for the first time therefor of course git did not allow me to do that again for the directory where I was at, when I typed `git remote add origin <URL.FROM.MY.GITHUB>`.  



## 1.5 Tracking Changes
Using your command line, create a new file called tracking-changes-reflection.md in the week-1 directory.

1. Open the file in sublime. Copy the following questions in it and answer them.
  - How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?

      Adding and tracking changes makes developers' lives easier because everyone else who is also working on the project will be able to see what else has been done and at what time and why it was done.  Also, later if something goes wrong, it is easy to revert to a known good saved state, and it's easy to find where things went wrong.
  - What is a commit?

     A commit is a saved state, where you can go back and look at the state of the files at that point.
  - What are the best practices for commit messages?
     1. The first line of the commit message should be a short description (50 characters is the soft limit), and should skip the full stop
     2. The body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:
        - uses the imperative, present tense, example: “edit” instead of “edited” or “edits”.
        - includes motivation for the change, and contrasts its implementation with previous behaviour.
  - What does the HEAD^ argument mean?

      `HEAD` by itself means the commit that you are currently on.  With the "^", when written as `HEAD^` it means the most recent commit.
  - What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?

     1. Adding or editing files in your working directory.  To check the status of these changes, type `git status`, and it should say "changes not staged for commit"
     2. To record the changes to the commit, type `git add [can be . or can be the filename(s)]`. This time, when typing `git status`, it should say "changes to be committed"
     3. Committing to this saved state, done by typing `git commit -m "imperative message here"`. Now when typing `git status`, it should say "On branch [branch-name-here]: nothing to commit, working directory clean".
  - Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?
    > `git pull origin master` (to make sure that you have the latest and greatest version of the project)

    > `git checkout -b [name_of_branch]` (to make sure that when you make a change gone awry, you can always revert to the original)

    > `git add [can be . or can be the filename(s)]` (prepares the changes to be committed)

    > `git commit -m "imperative message here"` (saved state, prepares the changes to be pushed to the remote repository)

    > `git push origin [your-branch-name-here]` (pushes the changes to the remote repository)

    > `git checkout master` (moves your view into the master branch)

    > either `git pull origin master`, or `git fetch origin master` then `git merge origin/master` (merges all the changes)
  - What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?

     A pull request is a way to tell others working on the same project about the changes that you have pushed to a repository like GitHub.  It makes collaborating on the project easier because others who are working on the project and can see the pull request too, will be able to review the changes and discuss it and make necessary modifications or give feedback before the changes are merged to the master version of the project.
  - Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?

      Pull requests are preferred when working with teams because it makes collaborating on a team project easier.  This works because others who are working on the project with you, and can see the pull request also, can help you by reviewing the changes, discussing them, giving feedback, etc. to the changes before they get merged to the master version of the project.  
2. Go through the git workflow you just established and add your reflection to the file. (If you are creating a video reflection, add the video link to your reflection file.)
3. Add your changes, commit them, and make a pull request to your repository.
4. Merge the pull request into your master branch

   Done! ^_^
