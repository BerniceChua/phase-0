# 1.6 Your Website, part 1

Now's the time to reflect on your learning! Remember to create a feature branch! Then (using your command line) in your phase-0/week-1 directory, create a file called my-website-1-reflection.md. Open the file in sublime, copy the questions below, and add your reflection to the file.  

#### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

   http://bernicechua.github.io/

#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

   Instructions for creating a new repo:

> Step 1 - If you don't have this already, create a login and password in GitHub.  

> Step 2 - In your own GitHub page, look for the "+" sign on the upper right corner beside your avatar/picture.  You'll know you're in the right place because when you hover over it, a sign will appear that says "Create new...".

> Step 3 - Click on "+" sign on upper right corner beside your avatar/picture.  A dropdown menu appears.

> Step 4 - On dropdown menu, please click "New repository".  A new screen will appear.

> Step 5 - In this new screen, you can customize things about your repo such as the name.  Please choose the name of your repo, choose whether or not the repo is public vs. private, and choose what kind of license is being used, since these are required.  The others are optional, but you can add information on them if you want.  

> Step 6 - When you have made sure that everything in Step 5 is to your liking, please click "Create Repository".  Congratulations!  You have made a repository in GitHub.

> Step 7 - In order to add more files to this repository, let us link it to your local machine through git.  For this, please make sure that you have git installed from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads (Links to an external site.)

> `git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username Here"`

> `git config --global user.email "your.email@address.com"`

(The End)

 

Instructions for forking an existing repo:

> Step 1 - If you don't have this already, create a login and password in GitHub.  

> Step 2 - Please go to the GitHub page of whichever repo you'd wish to fork.

> Step 3 - On the upper right corner of the screen, under your avatar/picture, there is a button called "Fork".  Please click on this.  

> Step 4 - Congratulations!  You have successfully forked a repo.  You'll know that you have done this correctly if the name before the slash of the repo name is your own username, and under that, it says "forked from originalUser/source" or something like that, and the picture beside it is a branch instead of a book.  

> Step 5 -  In order to add more files to this repository, let us link it to your local machine through git.  For this, please make sure that you have git installed from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads (Links to an external site.).

> Step 6 - On the right sidebar of the forked repo's page, there is a box under "HTTPS clone URL".  Please click the box beside it that says "Copy to clipboard" when you hover over it.

> Step 7 - Please open your CLI.  Please "cd" to the directory where you want to save your cloned git repos.

> Step 8 - Once you are in the directory that you want, please type this command:

> `git clone ` (and before hitting "Enter" on the keyboard, paste the URL that was copied in Step 6.  NOW, hit Enter).

> Congratulations!  You now have a copy of this forked repo on your desktop.

(The End)

#### Describe what open source means.

   Open Source software aka "Free Open Source Software / FOSS" is the practice of sharing a program's internal source code and how it was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.  There are a lot of source code that's free to use, just because some people like to do something because they can (I mean for the sake of being creative).  Some others are free to download and use, but the company makes money from support services (example, RedHat or Fedora).  

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

   I really like Open Source because it's a nice alternative to having to pay for so much software.  For example, A lot of software that I use like Open Office and Libre Office are good alternatives to Microsoft Office, or I use GIMP instead of Adobe Creative Suite for image editing since I'm not a professional digital graphic artist so it's not worth it for me to pay for the tools, but at the same time I need something that has more features than MS Paint.  

   One of the nice things about Open Source is that when other people see a source code, they can contribute to it, like bug fixes or adding new features or improving existing ones.  Now that I'll become better at programming it will also be nice to contribute something as well. ^__^  

   The cool thing about Open Source is that since people can collaborate on it, there's a nice sense of community for people even if they don't live in the same geographic area.  

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.

   It's important to use licenses because that let's others know how you want your work to be used or attributed.  For example, people can know what happens to software derived from the original source code, or whether or not software derived from the source code can be used for profit or not, and whether or not software derived from the source code must be shared/open source also.  

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

   Because I used git and GitHub a lot more now, I'm more comfortable using it without having to think of the next step in the sequence.  But I have more questions now than before about git.  For example, what's the difference between git fetch vs git pull, and git merge vs git rebase.  I'm reading different sources from Stackoverflow and http://git-scm.com/doc and http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

#### Using your new git and GitHub skills, commit and push your changes to your remote repository and go through the pull request process! Make sure you can see your reflection on GitHub. 

   Done! ^_^
