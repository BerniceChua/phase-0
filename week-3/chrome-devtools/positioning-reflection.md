**_How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you 
format or position elements?_**
    Chrome's DevTools inspector is very useful for formatting 
    or positioning elements, because we can use it to test 
    out what effect something will have on the selected 
    element directly on the browser and we can see the change instantaneously, sometimes even as easily as unchecking 
    the box of that property just to see.  

    It is the same as testing the appearance/formatting of 
    something through an editor/IDE, but better because we 
    didn't need to re-save on the editor then reload the 
    page each time.  

    Also, there is a section under the "Styles" tab of "Elements" 
    which shows the padding, borders, and margins, etc. of an 
    element, which makes it easy to visualize why something is 
    positioning itself or behaving in an unexpected way (for 
    example, I want the position of something to be in the 
    center but it's not happening, because the margin is really 
    wide.  See screenshot):

**_How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?_**
    In CSS, the size of an element on the DOM can be changed by:
        * _height_ & _width_ properties (pretty self-explanatory)
        * _border_ property = if a border is thick enough, it also 
        increases the size of the element.  
        * _display_ property = if an element has a display 
        property of `block` or `inline-block`, it will retain 
        the shape specified by `height` & `width`.  If the 
        `display` property is set to `inline`, the size of the 
        element will shrink to fit the text inside it.
