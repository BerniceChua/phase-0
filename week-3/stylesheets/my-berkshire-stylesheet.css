    - What is important to know when linking an external file (like a 
    stylesheet) to an HTML file?

	It is important to make sure that the path to the external file is 
	correct, or else the effects of that file won't appear in the HTML 
	file.  

	Also, it is important to make the syntax correct, like this:
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/of/my/stylesheet.css">

    - What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard 
    was it to get the site as you wanted it?  

	To help with positioning, we used float; width; padding-bottom; 
	font-size; padding-top; margin-top; & display.  

    - What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

	We used: background-color; color; text-align; font-variant; font-size; 
	font-weight; border-top; border-left; border-right; border-bottom; border-color;
	border-style; float; width; padding-bottom; font-size; padding-top; margin-top; 
	& display.  

    - Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you 
    chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
    When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had 
    cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

    Yes, we modified the HTML file to include classes, but no IDs.  We chose classes, 
    because they are more
