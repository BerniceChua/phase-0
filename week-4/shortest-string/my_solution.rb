# Shortest String

# I worked on this challenge [by myself; because this is a solo challenge].

# shortest_string is a method that takes an array of strings as its input
# and returns the shortest string
#
# +list_of_words+ is an array of strings
# shortest_string(array) should return the shortest string in the +list_of_words+
#
# If +list_of_words+ is empty the method should return nil

Pseudocode
    Input = array of integers
    Output = largest integer

    Step 1: get user input (array of integers, called "list_of_nums").
    Step 2: make a variable to hold results -- "largest".
    Step 3: set largest equal to first integer of "list_of_nums"
    Step 4: UNTIL end of the array is reached: compare "largest" to next 
        number in the array.  
    Step 4.1: IF the next number is larger than the number in "largest", 
        replace "largest" with the next number.
    Step 4: return the result of largest.
