# ruby-review-1 (Fibonacci) Release 2: Reflect
In the reflection section in your ruby_review.rb file, answer the following questions:

### What concepts did you review in this challenge?

In this challenge, we reviewed:
- pseudocoding
- thinking of the logic
- flow control
- refactoring


### What is still confusing to you about Ruby?

What is still confusing to me about Ruby is when I can use symbols to be what gets 
returned by a class's method, like in the "guessing game" challenge.  

It is this one:

https://github.com/BerniceChua/phase-0/blob/master/week-6/guessing-game/my_solution.rb


### What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?

To prepare for Phase 1, I will study some more about "yield", and probably scope.  
Most definitely, I'll study how to use the variables in "for...in" to access nested 
data structures, especially in JS because my pair and I had trouble with that.  
I think I'll also study more about using "assert", because I didn't start using it 
until I learned it from Dev Bootcamp.  (That was the reason I chose to practice/review 
with it, because it is my weak spot.)  

Aside from that, I want to study more about databases and SQL.  I feel like our 
exposure to SQL in week 8 felt like an afterthought.  

Also, I want more practice using JS to manipulate the DOM.  


# ruby-review-2 (Car Class) Release 2: Reflect
In the reflection section in your ruby_review.rb file, answer the following questions:

### What concepts did you review in this challenge?

In this challenge, we reviewed:
- pseudocoding
- thinking about: 
-- what is the best way to structure the code
-- what is the "minimum viable product" or what kind of complexity this project needs
- classes in Ruby
